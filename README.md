# About Gimel Studio

This branch tracks the next development of Gimel Studio. It is currently in ``initial planning/development`` stage, working towards a usable MVP application. Things will probably change **a lot** from what is currently here.

Youâ€™re always welcome to help out, ask questions, give feedback, and suggest ideas/improvements.

# Running the code

*Please note: At this stage of development, the code is highly WIP and likely to change a lot. Many things are not implemented and not stable. Please don't expect too much at this point...*
