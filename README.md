# About the Next Generation of Gimel Studio

**The original (more stable) version of Gimel Studio is available [here](https://github.com/Correct-Syntax/Gimel-Studio).**

This repository tracks the *next step* of Gimel Studio (the v0.6.x series) to become a truly usable and serious node-based, non-destructive image editor. It is currently in ``initial planning/development stage`` and things will probably change from what is currently here. 

**We're especially seeking Python and/or GLSL developers, 3D artists, photographers and UI designers to help with the project.** However, even if you have none of these skills you're still welcome, of course, to give feedback and suggest ideas and improvements. :)


# WIP Mockup

Here is a **WIP mockup** of the redesigned UI:

!["Gimel Studio mockup"](https://i.ibb.co/Pr5RKyn/gimel-studio-ui-mockup.png "Gimel Studio")


# Discord & Gitter

If you'd like to join development, help with the UI design or have questions, comments or ideas you can join the Gimel Studio [Discord](https://discord.gg/RqwbDrVDpK) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Gimel-Studio/community). These are places where you can chat with the developers and project contributors and get the latest updates on development.


# Vision

The main goal is to expand on and greatly improve upon the concepts from the [original version](https://github.com/Correct-Syntax/Gimel-Studio) of Gimel Studio to create a serious (yet fun!) 2D graphics editor. 

This includes:

- Re-designed UI (highly inspired by the Blender 2.8x UI and parts of Sketch)
- Improved file-type support (.tiff, .exr files, etc)
- 16-bit workflow support
- CPU and GPU based processing
- Highly improved node-graph and overall workflow for image editing
- Greater emphasis on re-usabilty of nodegraph setups via templates, etc
- User preferences and UI translations
- Gizmos for the viewport to allow for WYSIWYG-like interaction for transforms, etc (e.g: crop, rotate, etc)
- Continued improvement and additions to the Python API for scripting custom nodes

Nodes can be used to composite, create/add new effects and/or composite raster and vector graphics on-demand. Helpful gizmos in the interactive viewport can be used to do various editing tasks and speed up the workflow. Preset node graph templates can be created, used and re-used to save time setting up common node-setups. 

Custom nodes can be scripted with the built-in Python API for maximum flexibility. Integrations with other software like Blender are planned.

With a fully non-destructive workflow that uses both GPU and CPU processing while being seamlessly cross-platform on Windows, Linux and MacOs (for 64-bit systems), Gimel Studio aims to be a simple, yet powerful 2d graphics editing tool for beginners and pros alike.

# Immediate Tasks before MVP

This is a short list of some immediate tasks we're working on:

- [ ] Improve Node graph to include image thumbnails, shortcuts, etc (via GS Nodegraph)
- [ ] Continue to implement and refine custom widgets and the nodegraph
- [ ] Continue to fully transition to custom widgets (vs. native widgets)
- [ ] Node Registry 
- [ ] Add Node menu/wheel
- [ ] Preferences/Configuration dialog and backend
- [ ] Pre-built Python wheels for OpenImageIO

Take a look at the [Github Issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues) for details on these and other immediate and future tasks to be done. 

Pull requests are always welcome! :)


# Running the code

*At this early stage of development, the code is very WIP and likely to change a lot. Many things are not implemented and/or not stable.*

## Windows

1. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
2. Get the OIIO (OpenImageIO) pre-built python wheel (Windows only) [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openimageio) and install it.
3. ``python src/main.py``

## Linux

1. ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
2. If building wxPython fails, Download the wheel file for wxpython which matches your Python version and Linux OS version from https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/ and install the wxpython package with ``pip3 install <pathtothewheelfilehere>``
3. ``python src/main.py``

Please note that the renderer, which relies on OIIO (OpenImageIO) will be **disabled if OIIO is not found**. The rest of the application will run, but the renderer will not work.

For platforms other than Windows, OIIO will need to be [built from source](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/INSTALL.md#building-from-source) since pre-built wheels are not yet available. See [this issue](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues/1).

## MacOs

Building should be the same as for Linux, **but it has never been tested.** We're looking for a maintainer to handle MacOs-related fixes, etc since the current developers do not own a Mac. If you would like to do so feel free to say so in Discord or Gitter.


# Tech Stack

[Python](https://python.org) - We can effectively use Python's strong suits (ease-of-use, portability, multitude of packages, large community, etc) and get the performance required by relying on lower-level and performant external libraries to do the heavy lifting (where implementing something in Python would be a bottleneck).

We also plan to use **GLSL and/or it's variants in addition to Python** for image-editing, as applicable, via [ModernGL](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl), [glnext](https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/glnext) or another graphics rendering API (suggestions welcome!).

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Numpy will be the "data-exchange" format, the core image format used for the backend of Gimel Studio. It will be used as "glue" to combine OIIO, GMIC, etc.

[OpenImageIO](https://openimageio.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2.8.0/) - OIIO will be used for image IO and (possibly) some image editing. OpenImageIO (OIIO) is a library for reading, writing, and processing images in a wide variety of file formats, using a format-agnostic API. It is used in professional, large-scale visual effects and feature film animation, and it is used ubiquitously by large VFX studios, as well as incorporated into many commercial products.

[Cario](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices, including SVG, etc. We will use either cairo or [Skia graphics engine](https://skia.org/) for vector graphics support.

[G'MIC](https://gmic.eu/) - For additional image effects and filters (CPU-based). *Mainly need to wait for the [GMIC python bindings](https://github.com/myselfhimself/gmic-py) to support Windows and MacOs before implementing this into Gimel Studio, but this probably won't be implemented until after the core is stable anyway.*

[wxPython](https://wxpython.org) -  Will be used as the **primary GUI front-end** as it's a powerful, native, cross-platform GUI toolkit based on wxWidgets. For good examples of wxpython used as a toolkit for graphics applications see [sK1 vector graphics editor](https://sk1project.net/) and [ImagePy](https://github.com/Image-Py).

A greatly improved nodegraph for Gimel Studio is currently in development via the [GS Nodegraph](https://github.com/GimelStudio/gsnodegraph) library.

Modern, style-able widgets for Gimel Studio are currently in development via the [GS WidgetKit](https://github.com/GimelStudio/gswidgetkit) library.

**API Scripting Language:** Python, of course. :)
