# Contributing to Gimel Studio

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. We're excited to have you!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Gimel Studio, which are hosted in the [Github Organization](https://github.com/GimelStudio) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something in an orderly manner.

Gimel Studio is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting UI translations, bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Gimel Studio itself.

## Asking For Help

**Please, don't use the issue tracker for general support questions**. Check whether the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/discussions) or channels on the official [Discord](https://discord.gg/RqwbDrVDpK) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Gimel-Studio/community) can help with your issue. Discord is where most of the development chat happens (currently) and it's likely you will get your answer the quickest there.


## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Technical

Gimel Studio itself is written in pure Python so most code contributions will require at least a basic knowledge of Python 3+.

*Eventually, at least some nodes will also be using GLSL shaders or the like for on-GPU image-manipulation.*

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will often announce it in the Discord and/or Gitter. Feel free to ask questions and/or suggest ideas there!


## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Gimel Studio. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the template as the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Make sure to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined  your bug is related to, create an issue in the repository and provide as much helpful information as you can to help us understand the problem.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Gimel Studio? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good First issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code and/or don't require an in-depth knowledge of the existing code.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you have any questions about contributing, feel free to ask on the official [Discord](https://discord.gg/RqwbDrVDpK) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Gimel-Studio/community).


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
* Use sentence case except for referencing a file, method, function, class, etc in the code
* Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Python Code

Python code should largely follow PEP8 guidlines, except:

* The line length can be greater than the PEP8 character limit
* Capitalization of function and method names are acceptable since this is the style used in wxPython (the GUI library).

### Python File Naming Conventions

* Python file names should use "snake case" and no capital letters (``nodegraph_pnl`` not ``nodegraphpnl``)

### Folder Naming Conventions

Should you need to create a new folder: Folder names should be short, with no spaces and no capital letters (``corenodes`` not ``core_nodes``), except for UI translation folders which are based on the locale (e.g: ``fr_FR``).
