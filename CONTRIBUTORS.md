# Gimel Studio Contributors

This aims to be a complete list of the direct contributors to Gimel Studio since the [GitHub contributors graph](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/graphs/contributors) only shows code contributions. However, it is possible that someone that should be on this list was ommitted unintentionaly. Feel free to open a pull request to amend this list.

Generally, a "direct" contribution includes contributing code, documentation, and UI/UX design.
