/**
 * @brief A BindingEvaluator provides a mechanism to control the exact time
 * when a KDBindings::Binding is reevaluated.
 *
 * A BindingEvaluator represents a collection of Binding instances that can be
 * selectively reevaluated.
 *
 * If a Binding is created using KDBindings::makeBoundProperty with a BindingEvaluator,
 * the Binding will only be evaluated if BindingEvaluator::evaluateAll is called
 * on the given evaluator.
 *
 * Note that instances of BindingEvaluator internally wrap their collection of
 * Bindings in such a way that copying a BindingEvaluator does not actually
 * copy the collection of Bindings. Therefore adding a Binding to a copy of a
 * BindingEvaluator will also add it to the original.
 * This is done for ease of use, so evaluators can be passed around easily throughout
 * the codebase.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - @ref 06-lazy-property-bindings/main.cpp

 *
 * An example of how to use KDBindings::BindingEvaluator together
 * with a KDBindings::Property to create a Property binding that is
 * only reevaluated on demand.
 *
 * The output of this example is:
 * ```
 * The initial size of the image = 1920000 bytes
 * The new size of the image = 8294400 bytes
 * ```
 *
 * Note the difference to @ref 05-property-bindings/main.cpp, where the
 * new size of the image is calculated twice.
 *
 * This feature is especially useful to reduce the performance impact of
 * bindings and to create bindings that only update in specific intervals.

 * the rendering of the example code to break because it is missing a
 * newline-->
