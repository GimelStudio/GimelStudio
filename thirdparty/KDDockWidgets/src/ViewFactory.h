 * @brief A factory class for allowing the user to customize some internal views.

 * You should however not derive directly from ViewFactory, and instead, derive from
 * ViewFactory_qtwidgets (for QtWidgets), or ViewFactory_qtquick (for QtQuick).
 *
 * Sub-classing ViewFactory allows for fine-grained customization and
 * styling of some non-public widgets, such as titlebars, dock widget group and
 * tab widgets.
 *
 * To set your own factory see Config::setViewFactory()
