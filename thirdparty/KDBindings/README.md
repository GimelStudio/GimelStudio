KDBindings
==========
Reactive programming & data binding in C++

From plain C++ you get:

 * Signals + Slots.
 * Properties templated on the contained type.
 * Property bindings allowing reactive code to be written without having to do all the low-level, error prone plumbing by hand.
 * Lazy evaluation of property bindings.
 * No more broken bindings.
 * Totally stand-alone "header-only" library. No heavy Qt dependency.
 * Can still be used with Qt if you so wish.

Using KDBindings

KDBindings requires a C++ compiler with C++17 support.
