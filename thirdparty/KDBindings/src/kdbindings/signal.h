 * @brief A Signal provides a mechanism for communication between objects.
 *
 * KDBindings::Signal recreates the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html">Qt's Signals & Slots mechanism</a> in pure C++17.
 * A Signal can be used to notify any number of slots that a certain event has occurred.
 *
 * The slot can be almost any callable object, including member functions and lambdas.
 *
 * This connection happens in a type-safe manner, as a slot can only be connected to
 * a Signal when the arguments of the slot match the values the Signal emits.
 *
 * The Args type parameter pack describe which value types the Signal will emit.

 * Examples:
 * - @ref 01-simple-connection/main.cpp
